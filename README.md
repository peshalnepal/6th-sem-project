# Animal-Monitoring-System
This is one of our first handware project where me with my friends created an animal monitoring system. This system is responsible for locating animal using Gps tracker in the custom collar we build along with the temperature sensor and heart beat sensor. Data from all those sensor is sent to us using custom hardware to our devices which then upload it to the server.
